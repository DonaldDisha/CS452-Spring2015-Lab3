My program presents a blue 3D trapezoid that is rotated:
-left arrow - rotate counterclockwise about the Y axis
-right arrow - rotate clockwise about the Y axis
-up arrow - rotate counterclockwise about the X axis
-down arrow - rotate clockwise about the X axis

Light is being shone via the phong lighting model and I used a perspective projection matrix to show the shape.
